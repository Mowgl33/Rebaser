# Rebaser

Rebaser is a simple tool that you can use to rebase a decimal number with a base of your choosing (within reason). It served as a useful exercise to understand how numbers can be counted using bases other than 10. In turn, this folds into my understanding of binary digits (bits) and how they can be used to represent all manner of arbitrary information.
